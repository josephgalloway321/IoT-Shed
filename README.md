# IoT Shed

![Shed](Images/shed.jpg)

The IoT Shed is a project focused on adding automation and internet connectivity to an ordinary shed. The project includes light automation, cooling the inside of the shed, battery monitoring, and a website to control and monitor everything remotely. 

This repository includes everything needed to make this project on your own. Please feel free to fork the code and schematics and make your own version. If you do, then please share your final version with me! I'd love to see how you improved upon my design for your own shed. I included a [future work](#future-work) section to provide some ideas.

## About this document
This document has two sections - a section giving an [overview](#overview) of how everything works and a section that provides a [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide) for replicating this project on your own.

### Components
The following components are used in the project. Each component shown has a link to a brief tutorial showing you how to use them and a simple circuit for testing.
- [PIR Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/overview)
- [Power Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ina260-current-voltage-power-sensor-breakout)

More information for each sensor can be found on the website links found in the [bill of materials](#bill-of-materials) section.
However, the following components do not have a tutorial link, so a simple circuit is shown for testing. If these don't provide enough information, then please search the device name on YouTube to find more details.
- Release Valve w/ level shifter
- Temp. sensor
- Rain sensor w/ optocoupler
- LEDs
- Fan
- Air compressor
- Limit switch

### Future Work
This section provides some ideas for you to build upon my version. They're just ideas I thought of while I was working on this project.
- Bluetooth speakers
- External antenna
- Fan to keep relay board cool with a temperature sensor dedicated to the relay board
- Use a buck converter to power a 5V terminal block from the main 12V power source instead of using a separate 5V battery pack
- Use a buck converter to power a separate 12V terminal block from the main 12V power source instead of using a separate 12V battery pack (Lower current for sensors and relay board that can't handle the high current coming from the main 12V power source)
